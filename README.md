# Full-Stack Proj  
A comprehensive full-stack web application built by **Roshini Pakkurthi** as part of my portfolio. This project covers both front-end and back-end development, showcasing how to build, integrate, and deploy a complete end-to-end application.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
In this project I’ve built a web application from the ground up that encompasses:  
- A clean and interactive **front-end** built using modern web technologies.  
- A robust **back-end** API / server-side logic to handle data, authentication, and business rules.  
- Database integration to store and retrieve application data.  
- Deployment to make the application accessible publicly or on a local server.  
- Implemented features typical of real-world web apps like user registration/login, CRUD operations, data validation, error handling, and responsive design.

The goal: to demonstrate that I can design, build, test, and deploy a full-stack web app—bridging my background in data / dev and preparing for roles beyond just scripting.

## 🧠 Features  
- User authentication (signup, login, logout)  
- User profile page and settings  
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) of core application entities (e.g., posts/items/users)  
- RESTful API endpoints for the back-end  
- Responsive front-end UI (mobile + desktop friendly)  
- Data validation and form error handling  
- Possibly file upload, search/filter functionality, pagination (depending on your implementation)  
- Connection to a database (SQL or NoSQL)  
- Deployment instructions or live demo link if available
